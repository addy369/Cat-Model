# Cat-Model
Can you please review the code?
I had to google a lot to find appropriate libraries and correct functions
I am confused about what model.fit_generator,flow_from_directory does.
Also I do not know how to set labels for training data(0 for cat 1 for dog)
Also I am not sure how to predict for train set.
Also is the model okay, what changes can I make?Hyperparameters and all?
